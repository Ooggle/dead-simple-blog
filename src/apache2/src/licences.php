                    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>

                    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>

                    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
                    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
                    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
                    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>

                4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>

                    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
                    meet the following conditions:<br>
                    <br>
                    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
                        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
                    <br>
                    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
                        stating that You changed the files; and<br>
                    <br>
                    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
                        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
                        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
                        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
                        the Derivative Works; and<br>
                    <br>
                    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
                        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
                        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
                        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
                        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
                        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
                        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
                        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
                        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
                        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
                        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
                        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
                        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
                        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
                        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
                        as modifying the License.<br>
                    <br>
                    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
                    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
                    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
                    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
                    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
                    the conditions stated in this License.<br>
                    <br>
                5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
                    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
                    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
                    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
                    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
                    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
                    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
                    <br>
                6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
                    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
                    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
                    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
                    <br>
                7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
                    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
                    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
                    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
                    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
                    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
                    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
                    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
                    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
                    <br>
                8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
                    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
                    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
                    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
                    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
                    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
                    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
                    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
                    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
                    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
                    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
                    <br>
                9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
                    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
                    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
                    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
                    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
                    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
                    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
                    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
                    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
                    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
                    <br>
                END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
